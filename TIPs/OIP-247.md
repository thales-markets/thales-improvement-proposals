| OIP-247 | End public liquidity provision for OVERTIME markets (USDC/WETH/cbBTC/wBTC)  | Draft  | @RealBigPenny  | End public liquidity provision for OVERTIME markets (USDC/WETH/cbBTC/wBTC)             							  | [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/overtime-io) | 2025-06-18 |

## Simple Summary

This OIP proposes to end public liquidity provision for OVERTIME markets, harmonizing the USDC/WETH/cbBTC/wBTC pools with the OVER LP.

## Abstract

OVERTIME allows everyone to provide liquidity in form of USDC/WETH/cbBTC/wBTC which will be used to collateralize OVERTIME markets. The idea was that this will ensure deep liquidity pools, so more and better funded markets can be created which allow for more and bigger bets. Public funding was also supposed to a form of risk mitigation at a time when Overtime was still a new offering with unknown risk factors, by spreading losses across many depositors. However time has shown that OVERTIME does not require third party funds to collateralize its markets. The supposed risk mitigation has also proven to be ineffective since depositors have repeatedly ended up leaving the LPs in times of repeat losses. Also, instead of "socializing" losses during oracle failures and other issues, depositors have been expecting compensations from treasury and both Governance and pDAO have been feeling responsible to providing compensation such compensation on multiple occasions. Public LPs have therefore been effectively reduced to a free profit sharing mechanism with little to no benefits for the protocol. This OIP will end public liquidity provision for OVERTIME markets by harmonizing the USDC/WETH/cbBTC/wBTC pools with the OVER LP and handing over responsibility to Treasury for funding markets and bearing the inherent risk, which it effectively already does. Without profit sharing, more funds remain at the protocol, working towards long term profitability of the protocol.

## Motivation

The initial rationale for allowing public liquidity provision in OVERTIME markets was to ensure deep liquidity, enable larger and more diverse markets, and mitigate early-stage risks by distributing them across many depositors. However, experience has shown that these goals were not achieved: public LPs have proven unreliable during loss cycles, and risk remains centralized as the protocol treasury has repeatedly borne the burden of compensation. In practice, public LPs have functioned more as a profit-sharing mechanism without delivering meaningful benefits to the protocol. Ending public liquidity provision and consolidating market funding under the Treasury aligns with the current reality, eliminates ineffective structures, and supports long-term protocol sustainability by retaining more capital within the system which can be used at the pDAOs discretion for protocol purposes.

## Specification

- Stop deposits to the OVERTIME USDC/WETH/cbBTC/wBTC LPs from non-treasury wallets.
- Initiate the withdrawal function for all non-treasury wallets. (Start the cooldown.)
- Prevent cancellation of the withdrawal.
- Treasury funds USDC/WETH/cbBTC/wBTC LPs as deemed necessary by pDAO.
- pDAO is authorized decide how to use LP profits. (e.g. keep in LP, use for BBB, grow treasury runway, etc.)

## Rationale

- **Sustainability**: Ends ineffective profit-sharing with public LPs, preserving more funds within the protocol.
- **Accountability Alignment**: Aligns funding and risk with the Treasury, which is already de facto bearing them.
- **Capital Efficiency & Control**: Consolidates liquidity under the Treasury, enabling more strategic capital deployment and allowing the Treasury to fully control and decide how profits are used.

## Test Cases

## Implementation

To be determined by pDAO.
