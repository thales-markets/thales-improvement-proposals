## Simple Summary

This proposal suggests adding Minimum Spread per Sport when calculating the spread per market in Sports AMM.

## Abstract

This proposal aims to add additional feature to Sports AMM by allowing for different minimum spreads per sport (ID) resulting in sharper odds

## Motivation

The Sports AMM currently has a default minimum spread for all sports. The intoduction of minimum spread per sport allows sharper odds for different sports. 
Specified odds per sport provides better edge for high rollers (in soccer) or prevents high exposure in more fluctuating odds for sports such as NBA. 

## Specification

Introduce new variable `min_spreadPerSport` in Sports AMM.  
The value is a spread percentage (%) and depends on the `sportID`.
Each sportID has its own minimum spread (%).

In case a minimum spread (%) is not defined for a sportID, the default minimum spread (%) is used.

## Test Cases

### Test Case A

Define minimum spread for EPL match (3 options game) = 2%  
SafeBox impact = 1%  
Sum of all odds: 1.03

### Test Case B

Define minimum spread for NBA game (2 options game) = 9%  
SafeBox impact = 1%  
Sum of all odds: 1.1


## Implementation

- minimum spread for EPL = 2%

- minimum spread for NBA = 9%
