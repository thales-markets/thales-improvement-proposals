| TIP-131 | Extend LP Incentives on Optimism | Draft | Svenska (@svenskafr) / Milkywave | Extension of LP Incentives on Optimism | https://discord.gg/thales | 2023-03-06


## Simple Summary

Extend current LP incentives program on Optimism.

## Abstract

This TIP proposes to extend our current incentives program on Arrakis for THALES-WETH pool and bribes to Velodrome THALES-USDC and THALES-WETH pools.  
  
Reward structure would stay as:  
  
- Arrakis THALES/WETH pool incentives: 3,000 OP + 30,000 THALES per week
- Velodrome THALES/USDC pool bribes: 8,000 THALES per week
- Velodrome THALES/WETH pool bribes: 8,000 THALES per week
  
These emissions are to run **until further revaluation**.  
  
## Motivation
 
Current ratio of incentives between Arrakis Uniswap wrapper and Velodrome provides a healthy and comfortable distribution of on-chain liquidity.

## Specification 

This TIP entials the Thales Protocol DAO and Treasury DAO to facilitate the following emissions:  
  
- Arrakis   Thales/WETH rewards -   3,000 OP + 30,000 Thales  per week
- Velodrome Thales/WETH bribes -   8,000 Thales per week + 50% veVELO NFT vote  
- Velodrome Thales/USDC bribes -   8,000 Thales per week + 50% veVELO NFT vote  
  
Bribes collected through voting in Velodrome are to be compounded into both pools weekly along with the claim of the veVelo rebase.  
  
The incentives in this proposal are to be valid **until further revaluation** from implementation.
