| TIP-238 | Same Game Parlays framework | Draft | Danijel| Add SGP framework to Overtime| [Discord](https://discord.gg/thales) | 2025-02-04

## Simple Summary
This TIP proposes a framework to add Same Game Parlays as supported betting option on Overtime

## Motivation

Same Game Parlays (SGPs) have become a staple in traditional sportsbooks, driving engagement and betting volume. However, decentralized sportsbooks lack this feature, creating a competitive gap.  

Integrating SGPs will:  
- **Enhance user engagement** by allowing bettors to customize high-reward wagers within a single event.  
- **Expand market appeal** to both casual and experienced bettors.  
- **Increase betting volume and liquidity**, strengthening the platform.  
- **Match industry standards**, keeping pace with traditional sportsbooks.  
- **Leverage smart contracts** for transparent and automated bet settlement.  

Adding SGPs will attract more users, boost liquidity, and position the sportsbook as a leading decentralized betting platform.


## Specification
The framework will use much of existing architecture, including the approach we use for Live Betting and the normal parlays architecture for Risk Management.   
It will be a two step approach using Chainlink nodes to validate quotes for SGPs and execute a trade. 

The workflow is as follows:
1. The user signals a potential SGP trade to SGPTradingProcessor contract by sending the SGP ticket details. 
2. The SGPTradingProcessor relays the request to the Chainlink Node  
3. The Chainlink Node invokes our supported data partners to receive quotes on the requested SGP. Currently supported sportbooks from which the quote can be fetched include DraftKings, BetMGM and BlueBook (formerly known as FanDuel)  
4. The Chainlink Node specific configuration on which sportsbooks it will use, and how it will apply additional fees or aggregation will be subject to pDAOs management.  
5. If the node approves the SGP trade, it executes a transaction on behalf of the user which verifies and writes the bet onchain. 

In case any of the legs of the SGP are cancelled and there are no lost legs, the whole ticket is cancelled.  
                    
## Rationale
Introducing Same Game Parlays (SGPs) aligns with Overtime’s goal of offering a competitive and engaging betting experience. SGPs allow users to combine multiple bets within a single event, creating higher-reward opportunities while increasing platform activity. By leveraging smart contracts, Overtime can ensure seamless settlement and transparency, differentiating itself from centralized sportsbooks. Implementing SGPs also strengthens liquidity and positions Overtime as a more versatile decentralized betting platform.

## Test Cases
| Step | Action | Expected Result |
|------|--------|----------------|
| 1 | User navigates to the NFL betting section on Overtime and selects SGP mode and then a game (e.g., Chiefs vs. Bills). | The game page loads with available betting markets. |
| 2 | User selects multiple bets within the same game: <br> - **Patrick Mahomes Over 275.5 Passing Yards** <br> - **Stefon Diggs Anytime TD Scorer** <br> - **Total Points Over 49.5** | The Overtime API confirms selections and displays updated odds. |
| 3 | User enters a stake amount and places the parlay bet. | The bet slip shows potential payout; user confirms the wager. |
| 4 | The Chainlink node validates the bet, if all successfull it records the wager on-chain. | Transaction is successful, and the bet ID is generated. |
| 5 | Game concludes; blockchain oracles fetch game results. | Each leg of the SGP is settled according to official stats. |
| 6 | If all selections are correct, the smart contract pays winnings. If any leg fails, the bet is graded as a loss. | Funds are automatically transferred based on outcome. |

- The bet is accurately settled based on game results.  
- Smart contract automation ensures transparency and fair payouts.  
- Users can verify bet history and transactions on the blockchain.
