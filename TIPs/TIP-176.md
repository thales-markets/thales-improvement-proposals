| TIP-176 | Add continuous staking rewards deflation | Draft  | Danijel | Add continuous staking rewards deflation |                | 2023-10-12 |

## Simple Summary

This TIP proposes to reduce base staking rewards every round by 1% compared to previous one 

## Motivation

Per initial THALES tokenomics, staking rewards were planned with a fixed schedule of 3 years with gradual declines. This is due to a finite number of THALES tokens.  
Since the initial tokenomics, there were many changes to exact staking rewards, but I believe we need to implement a smooth linear decline which will continuosly and almost seemlessly on a week per week level reduce base rewards by 1%.  
 
## Specification

On every staking round closing the rewards for next week will be set to 0.99x of the last rewards cycle. This makes up for a 40% annual decrease in rewards, but in result will make the rewards sustainable for a longer period.   
 
## Variables

weeklyDecrement = 0.99
