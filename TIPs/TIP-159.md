| TIP-159 | Optimal Liquidity Strategy on Velodrome | Draft | MΞthodic (@0xmethodic) | Create a PoL position on the USDC pool on Optimism with Velodrome | [discord](https://discord.gg/thales) | 2023-08-01 |

## Simple Summary

Allocate treasury assets towards a POL position on Velodrome and increase THALES rewards for THALES/USDC pool slightly to take advantage of Velodrome’s incentives efficiency and achieve a net profit strategy

## Abstract

On Optimism, Thales is currently incentivizing the following amounts on the respective platforms:
- Arrakis THALES/WETH pool incentives: `2,500 OP` + `24,000 THALES` per week (~$15K)
- Velodrome THALES/USDC pool incentives: `6,000 THALES` per week (~$2.7K)
- Velodrome THALES/WETH pool incentives: `6,000 THALES` per week (~$2.7K)

In addition, Thales recently passed a proposal to allocate about $350K worth of treasury assets towards a Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL) via Arrakis PALM.

This proposal aims to Optimize Thales’ liquidity strategy on Velodrome team to reduce reliance of incentives and THALES emissions over time by:
- Depositing a $300K POL position on the THALES/USDC pool: `330K THALES` & `150K USDC`
- Update Velodrome THALES/USDC pool incentives to: `725 OP` + `9,000 THALES` per week (~$5K)

These emissions are to run until further revaluation by the Thales Governance Structure.

## Specification

This TIP entails the Thales Protocol DAO and Treasury DAO to facilitate the following emissions and POL changes:
- Deposit and stake $300K of THALES/USDC POL (`330K THALES` & `150K USDC`) on Velodrome to capture VELO emissions
- Update Velodrome THALES/USDC pool incentives to: `725 OP` + `9,000 THALES` per week

$VELO emissions collected with POL will be locked into Thales' veNFT every week.

Rewards collected with POV are to be compounded into additional POL.
The incentives in this proposal are to be valid until further revaluation from implementation.
