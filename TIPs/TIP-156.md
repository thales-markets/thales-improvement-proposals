| TIP-156 |Launch Thales Products on Base Chain | Draft | fhd |Launch Thales Products on Base Chain |  | 2022-07-13
 
## Simple Summary
Launch Speed Markets on Base. The main collateral to be used should be USDC. Other products should be deployed later if speed markets prove to be successful and base chain as a whole is growing. Thales token should be bridged to Base as soon as possible. There should also be 300k of POL (Thales - USDC) when thales token is available to be bridged. This POL should be deployed to Uniswap, and moved to Aerodrome when possible. 



## Motivation
Base chain will have many users due to airdrop speculation, as well as just being new overall. Base chain will attract many users if we are well positioned when Base Chain mainnet goes live for the public.
