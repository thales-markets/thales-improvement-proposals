| TIP-220 | Change to Thales boost | Draft | holmberg | Change Thales boost more sustainable | discordlink | 2024-08-06

## Simple Summary
Change the Thales boost to financially sustainable for small odds.

## Motivation
Thales boost affects small odds proportionally more than large ones. However due to the skew, we have not faced problems or abusive betting yet, but that might be a problem in the future. We are currently on a knife edge with the Thales boost calculating formula.

## Specification
I suggest that bets with small odds with an implied probability >90% are removed temporarily from getting THALES boost. Because they are harmful to the protocol or at least might be. 

For repair in the future, I suggest that the bonus be changed to linear based on the actual odds and the bonus percentage be doubled to keep the bonus at the same level after this change.
I'm suggesting calculating it this way using decimal odds: 1 + (ODDS - 1) * BONUS = NEW ODDS

Example of a new and an old way
OLD
@1.01 ODDS: 1.01 * 1.01 = 1.02 (100% Difference in net profit)
@1.5 ODDS: 1.5 * 1.01 = 1.515 (3% Difference in net profit)
@10 ODDS: 10 * 1.01 = 10.1 (1.1% Difference in net profit)

NEW
@1.01 ODDS: 1 + (1.01 - 1) * 1.02 = 1.0102 (2% Difference in net profit)
@1.5 ODDS: 1 + (1.5 - 1) * 1.02 = 1.51 (2% Difference in net profit)
@10 ODDS: 1 + (10 - 1) * 1.02 = 10.18 (2% Difference in net profit)
