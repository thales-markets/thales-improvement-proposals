| OIP-243 | Reduce Overtime Council Seats | Draft  | @red   | Reduce the number of seats in the council from 7 to 5            | [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/overtime-io) | 2025-06-03 |

## Simple Summary

This OIP proposes reducing the number of seats on the Overtime Council from 7 to 5, with proposals requiring a passing vote of 3 out of 5.

## Abstract

This proposal introduces a streamlined governance structure by reducing the Overtime Council size from 7 to 5 seats. Future proposals will pass under a 3 out of 5 majority, whereas the current format requires a 5 out of 7 majority. The change maintains fairness, transparency, and oversight while lowering operational costs. Meta-governance proposals (those that alter governance rules) will continue to require unanimous approval, shifting from 7/7 to 5/5.

## Motivation

As Overtime has matured beyond its initial growth phase, the volume of active TIPs has decreased. The original 7-member council structure, designed for a busier early-stage governance environment, is no longer necessary. Reducing the council to five members will help optimize governance operations and reduce the associated costs.

## Specification

- Reduce the number of seats on the Overtime Council from 7 to 5.
- Standard proposals will require a majority vote of 3 out of 5 members to pass.
- Meta-governance proposals will require a unanimous vote of 5 out of 5 members to pass.
- The new council structure will take effect starting with the eleventh epoch, on July 1, 2025.

## Rationale

- **Cost Efficiency**: Fewer council members reduce the overall operational cost of governance.
- **Governance Maturity**: As the protocol has stabilized and the volume of proposals has lessened, a smaller council is sufficient to maintain effective oversight.

## Test Cases

Not applicable.

## Implementation

As a meta-governance TIP, this proposal requires unanimous approval (7 out of 7 votes) to pass.
