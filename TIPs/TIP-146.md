| TIP-146 | PartnerFee | Add volume partner fee and transaction partner code parameter to Thales and Overtime markets | https://discord.gg/8bzFdpGTrp | 2022-06-06
 
## Simple Summary
 
As a protocol, both Thales and Overtime allow for and welcome integration with other protocols and frontends for sustainable and decentralized protocol volume growth. Adding a `partnerFee` configurable and an optional `partnerCode` transaction parameter at the protocol level will allow integrators to capture fees from the volume they route through both Thales and Overtime markets. 

 ## Motivation

By introducing a `partnerfee` configurable we can ensure that integration is worthwhile for ecosystem partners. 

## Specification

- Introduce a `partnerFee` configurable that sets the fee rate for integrating partners. Set `partnerFee` initially to 0.5%.
- Implement an optional `partnerCode` transaction parameter that passes a partner's code associated with a partner wallet address on each respective chain. pDao is to be responsible for vetting and register partner codes.
- A transaction that passes on a partner code is to override and void any individual referrals under the referral programs defined in TIP-54 and TIP-68 for the underlying transaction.
