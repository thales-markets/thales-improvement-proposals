## Simple Summary

Additional tapering of AMM incentives and bribes across all exsiting incetivized LPs.

## Abstract

This TIP proposes additional tapering of AMM incentives and bribes across all exsiting incetivized LPs.

Current reward structure is:
- Optimism Arrakis THALES/WETH pool incentives: `20,000 THALES + 2,000 OP` per week
- Optimism Velodrome THALES/WETH pool bribes: `6,000 THALES` per week
- Optimism Velodrome THALES/USDC pool bribes: `9,000 THALES + 725 OP` per week
- Base Aerodrome THALES/WETH pool bribes: `10,000 THALES` per week
- Base Aerodrome THALES/USDbC pool bribes: `10,000 THALES` per week  
- Arbitrum Camelot THALES/WETH pool incentives: `5,000 THALES` per week

New reward structure to be:  

- Optimism Arrakis THALES/WETH pool incentives: 20,000 THALES + 2,000 OP per week (no change)
- Optimism Velodrome THALES/WETH pool bribes: 6,000 THALES per week  (no change)
- Optimism Velodrome THALES/USDC pool bribes: 6,000 THALES per week (~30% reduction)
- Base Aerodrome THALES/WETH pool bribes: 7,000 THALES per week (30% reduction)
- Base Aerodrome THALES/USDC pool bribes: 3,000 (70% reduction)
- Arbitrum Camelot THALES/WETH pool incentives: 5,000 THALES per week (no change) 
These emissions are to run for **8 weeks** until further revaluation.  
  
## Motivation
 
Currently, THALES onchain liquidity is relatively deep and more than sufficient, at over $4m TVL. This includes protocol owned liquidy. As for the incentivized pools, TVL/cost efficiency is low in the Velodrome and Aerodrome pools, the latter significantly. Given this fact, this TIP suggests to decrease ongoing incentives / bribes to those pools spefically.

## Specification 

This TIP entials the Thales Protocol DAO and Treasury DAO to facilitate the following emissions:  
  
- Optimism Arrakis THALES/WETH pool incentives: `20,000 THALES + 2,000 OP` per week
- Optimism Velodrome THALES/WETH pool bribes: `6,000 THALES` per week
- Optimism Velodrome THALES/USDC pool bribes: `6,000 THALES + 500 OP` per week
- Base Aerodrome THALES/WETH pool bribes: `7,000 THALES` per week
- Base Aerodrome THALES/USDbC pool bribes: `3,000 THALES` per week  
- Arbtirum Camelot THALES/WETH pool incentives: `5,000 THALES` per week

The incentives in this proposal are to be valid for a period of `8 weeks` from implementation.
