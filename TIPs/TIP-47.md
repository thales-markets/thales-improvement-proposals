## Simple Summary
 
This TIP proposes to extend the LP staking program for 7 weeks, until July 1st 2022, with the same LP staking rewards of 45,000 THALES weekly
 
## Abstract
 
The current LP incentive program in place Optimism is ending on Friday May 13. This TIP proposes to extend the LP staking rewards for the THALES/WETH G-UNI pool on Optimism with 7 more weeks and 45,000 THALES tokens weekly.
 
## Motivation
 
With the extension of LP staking rewards for 7 more weeks, until the start of the month July, Thales Protocol will ensure sufficient THALES token liquidity on Optimism. With the recent news about the official Optimism OP token release and Thales being eligible for a certain allocation, the extension of the program is to be put in place to provide stable support for liquidity until the Thales Treasury is ready to deploy additional OP tokens as a secondary form of incentives.
 
## Specification
 
  - This TIP entails the Thales Protocol DAO to extend THALES rewards towards THALES/WETH G-UNI LP token stakers until July 1st 2022, with the same weekly emissions of 45,000 THALES tokens.
