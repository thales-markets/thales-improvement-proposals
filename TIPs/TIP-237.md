| TIP-237 | Formalizing meta-governance TIPs | Draft | Svenska (@0xsvenska) | Formalizing meta-governance TIPs requirements | [Discord](https://discord.gg/thales) | 2024-11-26

## Simple Summary
This TIP proposes to formalize the definition of a meta-governance TIP, clarify when it's required and what it means in terms of votes needed for it to be voted by Thales Council members.

## Abstract
Up until now, this notion of meta-governance TIP has almost always met with consensus among the various successive council members, but it seems that this notion has never been clearly defined by a TIP.
[TIP-10](https://github.com/thales-markets/thales-improvement-proposals/blob/main/TIPs/TIP-10.md) defines the effective quorum of 5 votes for passing a TIP but no specifications regardinng meta-governance proposals.

## Motivation
This TIP is proposed solely for the purpose of clarifying what is a current oral consensus.

## Specification
A meta-governance proposal pertains to decisions that shape or redefine the fundamental governance structure, processes, or principles of a decentralized project. These proposals often involve core changes, such as:

- Amending voting mechanisms, such as quorum thresholds or decision-making processes
- Redefining the scope of authority for governance participants
- Fundamental changes to tokenomics
- Approving the acquisition of a protocol by the project or the acquisition of the project by an external protocol

This list is not exhaustive. Thales Council retains the authority to label additional proposals as meta-governance votes, based on their strategic importance and potential impact. This ensures flexibility in adapting governance practices to unforeseen or unique situations.

Such decisions influence how all other governance actions are made and implemented, making them foundational to the project's integrity and sustainability.

Requiring unanimous approval for a meta-governance proposal ensures that such critical decisions are made with the full consensus of all voting members. This 7/7 requirement threshold:

- Preserves protocol integrity: Governance frameworks are the backbone of decentralized projects, and changes to them must be handled with the utmost caution to avoid unintended consequences. Unanimity guarantees a robust check against potentially harmful or divisive changes.
- Builds trust among token holders: A unanimous requirement fosters inclusivity and collaboration, ensuring that all voices are heard and considered, which is crucial for the long-term health of the community and its governance.
- Reflects the critical nature of meta-governance: Unlike operational decisions, meta-governance proposals have far-reaching and often irreversible consequences. Requiring full agreement underscores their importance.

In summary, a unanimous vote (7/7) on meta-governance TIPs ensures that any change to the governance framework or critical strategic moves reflect the collective and unwavering agreement of all community members, safeguarding the decentralized nature and democratic principles of the project.

I consider this TIP as a meta-governance one so to be voted in, it will require a 7/7 unanimous vote.
