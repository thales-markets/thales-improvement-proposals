## Simple Summary
 
This TIP proposes to formally accept a nomination by L2DAO protocol for demonstrated Layer 2 leadership which entails Layer2DAO of sending 27,500 OP tokens to Thales Treasury DAO and execute a token swap with 50,000 THALES for 2,270,000 L2DAO tokens using Hedgey Finance tooling.
 
 ## Abstract

 The Layer2DAO has recognized significant potential in supporting Thales and thus has elected to nominate Thales as the first recipient of their OPIncubator program. This TIP proposes to formalize this nomination in the Thales Governance Structure which will allow Thales to receive 27,500 OP tokens from Layer2DAO's OPIncubator program and to facilitate a token swap of 50,000 THALES for 2,270,000 L2DAO tokens as a formalization of support and show of good faith.

## Motivation

Layer2DAO is a decentralized organization governed by the L2DAO token, that works towards investing in L2 native projects and thus supporting the growth of Layer 2 networks.  

Layer2DAO is governed by L2DAO token holders. Through the proposal and voting process L2DAO token holders determine the actions and direction of Layer2DAO.  

Thales has been identified by the Layer2DAO as a leader in on-boarding users to L2 via the deployment of Thales Protocol, Exotic Markets, and especially Overtime Markets.  

## Specification

This TIP entails the Thales Treasury DAO to formally accept 27,500 OP tokens from Layer2DAO and to facilitate a token swap of 50,000 THALES for 2,270,000 L2DAO from Layer2DAO.
