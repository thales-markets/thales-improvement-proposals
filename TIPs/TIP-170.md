## Simple Summary

Additional tapering of Arrakis and Velodrome incentives / bribes.

## Abstract

This TIP proposes to taper incentives to Arrakis THALES-WETH pool and bribes to Velodrome THALES-USDC and THALES-WETH pools on Optimism.
  
New reward structure to be:  
  
- Arrakis THALES/WETH pool incentives: `2,000 OP + 20,000 THALES` per week

These emissions are to run for **8 weeks** until further revaluation.  
  
## Motivation
 
With the recent initiatives in the likes of deploying a THALES/WETH PALM POL position on Optimism and pushing for THALES token presence on the Base network, it makes sense to slightly adjust reward emissions towards the THALES/WETH LPs on Optimism for the purpose of globally rebalancing THALES token emissions.

## Specification 

This TIP entials the Thales Protocol DAO and Treasury DAO to facilitate the following emissions:  
  
- Arrakis   Thales/WETH rewards -   `2,000 OP + 20,000 THALES`  per week

The incentives in this proposal are to be valid for a period of `8 weeks`` from implementation.
