| TIP-102 | Allow delegating volume for gamified staking| Draft | Danijel | Allow one wallet to delegate its volume for gamified staking rewards to another | https://discord.gg/rPpPcMXSeU | 2022-11-16


## Abstract

This TIP proposes to add a method to Staking THALES contract that allows one wallet to delegate all volume it generated to another wallet.
 
## Motivation
 
This is intended as quality of life improvement. As a large THALES staker I always use hardware wallets for staking, but when using Thales products such as UP/DOWN AMM or Overtime I prefer using a hot wallet just for convenience sake, e.g. using Overtime via mobile metamask.  
I would like the volume I generate via the hot wallets which are not staking to count towards my cold storage staking wallet rewards.    

## Specification 

Add a method to Staking THALES contract that allows a wallet to delegate all its future volume to another wallet. The delegation can be seized at any time and it always counts towards future generated volume, thus removing any risk surface of the same wallet boosting another wallet's volume while also boosting its own.
